          I'm 30 years old and currently studying Communication and Knowledge
          Media in Hagenberg, Upper Austria. Once upon a time, I was crunching
          numbers in the finance sector, but then I discovered the magical realm
          of Design — and I’ve never looked back.

        <p>
          I’m a versatile all-rounder with a passion for web development, UX/UI
          design, marketing, and video editing. I thrive on creativity and love
          combining technical skills with design to craft compelling digital
          experiences. Whether it’s coding an interactive website, refining a
          user interface, strategizing a marketing campaign, or editing engaging
          video content, I dive into every project with enthusiasm and
          dedication.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m highly motivated to learn, grow, and challenge myself. I embrace
          new technologies, explore fresh ideas, and constantly push boundaries.
          Innovation keeps me engaged, and I always give 110%.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I’m not geeking out over the latest tech trends, you’ll find me
          enjoying a drink with friends, conquering mountain peaks, smashing
          tennis balls with full power, or leading STRONG Nation classes making
          sure my participants work up a good sweat.
